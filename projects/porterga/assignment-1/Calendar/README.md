The Calendar is a Java application that provides classes and methods for storing diffirent appointments.
The Calendar also has several utilities, such as deleting appointments, sorting appointments, finding recurrences of appointments, and more.

This is my (porterga) version of the calendar, as it is seperate from the other (aburasa) calendar. My version has 5 bugs, some of which can
cause a crash.
